# Storage:
# SQLITE - For the launch of the plugin only.
# MYSQL - Allows creating a simple connection to the database, only for small servers.
# HIKARICP - HikariCP is a fast and lightweight JDBC connection pool. It optimizes database connections, ensuring quick acquisition and low latency. This improves performance and reliability, making it ideal for high-demand applications.
